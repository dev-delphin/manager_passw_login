The graphene-config.h header is system dependent, which means it cannot go in the global include directory. The appropriate place for this kind of headers is a directory under libdir.

    It is so painful to include it into any larger build system :(

It's really not, if you are using pkg-config --cflags graphene-1.0 to gather the compiler flags to be used when building code that depends on Grapheneâ€”which is how Graphene should be integrated in any build system.

Most definitely you should never move files installed by your distro around.
